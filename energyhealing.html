      <span>What is it</span>
      <h2>What is QHEH</h2>
      <p>Quantum Holographic Echo Healing is a modality that involves energy healing techniques aimed at promoting physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being by working with the body's energy systems to facilitate healing and balance. It draws from concepts in quantum physics and holistic healing to address various aspects of a person's well-being.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row gy-4">
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <h4 class="mb-4">Do you find yourself more drawn to Spirituality or Science? I don’t feel that it’s necessarily an either-or choice – I believe that the two can coexist harmoniously.</h4>
        <img src="assets/img/healingchakrawide.jpg" class="img-fluid mb-4 chakra" alt="">
        <p>Our subconscious mind is a reservoir of memories, experiences, thoughts, emotions, and beliefs acquired throughout our life journey, including those inherited from our ancestors through ancestral DNA. </p>
        <p>Even if we can't consciously recall a specific memory or event that gave rise to a limiting belief—like a sense of insecurity linked to your mother's early environment while you were an infant or even in the womb—our cells retain every emotional imprint. These emotional imprints are registered by the amygdala, the emotional memory hub of the brain, and communicated to the limbic system, which governs fear-driven responses.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <div class="content ps-0 ps-lg-5">
          <p class="">
            Consequently, as adults, we're instinctively prompted to feel, think, and act based on these long-forgotten emotional imprints. These responses can restrict us, especially if they stem from past negative encounters. 
            Transitioning from the impact of these imprints, people explore energy healing for transformative results:

            <li><i class="aboutsym fa-regular fa-circle fa-2xs mt-3" style="font-size: 15px; color: rgba(233, 202, 138, 1);"></i><strong>Balance and Stress Relief:</strong>  A release of emotional blockages and tension stored in your body can lead to a greater sense of emotional balance, reduced stress, and an overall improved sense of well-being.</li>
            <li><i class="healing-info fa-regular fa-circle fa-2xs mt-3" style="font-size: 15px; color: rgba(233, 202, 138, 1);"></i><strong>Spiritual Growth and Self-Discovery:</strong> People often choose energy healing to foster personal growth, gain insights into their life's purpose, and deepen their connection to their spirituality.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Practitioners like me focus on identifying and releasing energy blockages, emotional imprints, and limiting beliefs stored in the subconscious mind. Through various methods like guided visualisation, intention setting, and energy manipulation, they aim to promote self-discovery, inner harmony, and holistic healing.

              I had the best experience with Carina, I went into the session with lots going on in my head and everything came to the surface during our session. I can’t away feeling really positive and focused.

              Carina made me feel so comfortable and she had created a really relaxed atmosphere for the session.

              She clearly has a natural ability and I would definitely return for another reading, i loved it. ❤️✨

              Wow wow wow, what can I say I did not know what to expect going into my session.

              From the first part(meditation) every single step linked. It has opened up a whole new light in my life and made me realize I am truly a BOSS ASS BITCH that needs to own that shit🤣 every single thing made sense to me and my current state of mind. I am absolutely mind-blown. You here of stuff like this and don't expect that it's actually true.

              Carina is just amazing, she has such a bubbly personality that it just makes you so comfortable and the homely vibe makes you feel even more at ease. I would recommend 100000% Quantum holographic echo healing even if you are skeptical or nervous it is a form of self care that now I understand it I appreciate so much and will make it a regular thing to help my own mental health.

              Thankyou so much Carina 💕

              I had my first QHEH session with Carina a few weeks ago. Before visiting, I wasn't sure what to expect. Upon arriving, I felt the environment was calm & felt at ease as the process was fully explained to me in great depth of what the session included & how it was structured.

              During the session, Carina took the time to explain all sections and not once did it feel rushed.
 
              Following leaving Carina, more information from the session was provided by messages with detail of the sessions findings and some aftercare/homework.

              I would highly recommend Carina to someone that is looking for or to increase knowledge of their own self-discovery.
